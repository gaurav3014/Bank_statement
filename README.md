   - Analyze the frequency and amount of spending in each category.

4.  Income Analysis: 
   
   - What are the main sources of income (e.g., salary, UPI credits)?
   
   - Identify any patterns in the timing and amount of income received.

5.  Alert Generation:

### Conclusion
1.  Transactions: There were 983 transactions in total. Most were small, with 687 under $500 and 298 larger.

2. Balance: The account balance was steady for most of the year, except for November 2023 when large transactions happened.

3. Spending: Most money was spent through UPI (688 transactions) and ATM withdrawals (3 transactions).

4. Income: The main source of income was UPI credits (101 transactions).

5. Alerts: Alerts were generated when the balance was low (under 500) or spending was high (over $1000). These often happened at the same time, showing potential financial struggles.

The analysis shows regular income and spending patterns, with occasional financial stress due to large transactions and low balances. Monitoring these patterns can help manage finances better and plan for future stability.
